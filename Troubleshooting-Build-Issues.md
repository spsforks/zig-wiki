### Troubleshooting

#### Dual-Abi Linking

If you get one of these:

```
undefined reference to `_ZNK4llvm17SubtargetFeatures9getStringB5cxx11Ev'
undefined reference to `llvm::SubtargetFeatures::getString() const'
```

This is because of
[C++'s Dual ABI](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html).
Most likely LLVM was compiled with one compiler while Zig was compiled with a
different one, for example GCC vs clang.

LLVM, Clang, and Zig must all be compiled with the same C++ compiler.
