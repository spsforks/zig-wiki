# How to read the standard library source code

## Where is the stdlib code located?
You can find it under [`/lib/std/`](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/tree/master/lib/std).

## How is the stdlib structured?
When you import "std" in a Zig source file, you are importing [`/lib/std/std.zig`](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/tree/master/lib/std/std.zig).

```zig
const std = @import("std");
```

In that file you can see where each exposed symbol comes from:

```zig
// Excerpt from std.zig
...
pub const ArrayHashMap = array_hash_map.ArrayHashMap;
pub const ArrayHashMapUnmanaged = array_hash_map.ArrayHashMapUnmanaged;
pub const ArrayList = @import("array_list.zig").ArrayList;
pub const ArrayListAligned = @import("array_list.zig").ArrayListAligned;
pub const ArrayListAlignedUnmanaged = @import("array_list.zig").ArrayListAlignedUnmanaged;
pub const ArrayListUnmanaged = @import("array_list.zig").ArrayListUnmanaged;
...
```


Some parts of the stdlib are simple and are implemented in a single file, like `std.ascii`, which is entirely implemented in `/lib/std/ascii.zig`.

Other parts of the standard library are beefier and have their own dedicated subdirectory, like `std.math`. These "submodules" always have a regular structure: 
- A subdirectory that contains most of the implementation
- A file inside `/lib/std/` that exposes the public parts implemented in the relative subdirectory

In the case of `std.math`, for example, `/lib/std/math/ceil.zig` contains the implementation of ceil that then `/lib/std/math.zig` re-exports like this:

```zig
pub const ceil = @import("math/ceil.zig").ceil; 
```

The directory tree of the `std.ascii` and `std.math` files described above are arranged like so:

```
.
`-- lib/
    `-- std/
        |-- ascii.zig
        |-- math/
        |   `-- ceil.zig
        `-- math.zig
```

With this knowledge it should be easy for you to track down the implementation code of every symbol defined in the standard library.

One final trick: search for `pub fn` and `pub const` to quickly skim over the public API of an implementation.
