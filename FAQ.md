## Where is the documentation for the Zig standard library?

There is no stdlib documentation yet, but [it is planned for the next release](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/21). For now, the best ways to learn about the standard library are:

- Browse [the stdlib code](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/tree/master/std) to see what public functions and types are available.
- Check out [the community](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Community) and ask questions if you need help. Newcomers are always welcome!
