This pages a non-conclusive list of project ideas that a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) student would be able to undertake.

## Add Zig support to GDB

[Related Issue](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/614)

  - Expertise required: C (the GDB source is in C), possibly Python (parts of GDB are scriptable in python)
  - Potential Mentors: 


## First class support for FreeBSD

  - Expertise required: FreeBSD user
  - Potential Mentors: 


## General Purpose Allocator(s)

[Related Issue](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/480)

GeneralPurposeDebugAllocator and/or GeneralPurposeReleaseFast

  - Expertise required: computer science background


## self-hosted linking

[Related Issue](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/4314)

This task also includes [self-host libc building](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/4313) and [self-host cache hash](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/4311).

  - Expertise required: C++
  - Potential Mentors: 


## Improve the autogenerated Docs

Currently the docs generated from comments are incomplete, some improvements might be just as easy as displaying currently missing doc comments, while some others might be about more complex comptime metaprogramming scenarios. The student could mix-and-match which parts to tackle depending on their level of expertise.

## Implement a regular-expression Engine

The roadmap for `zig build` and overall packaging strategy is no doubt going to rely on performing dynamic probes of the host environment at build-time. Take for example the current stage1 compiler where it probes and caches host compiler paths. We also need to do things like spawn pipelines, feed and read inputs and outputs and all that is helped with regex whenever there are more difficult matches to be made. Here is an example of a command probing for sdk-path and we can sanitize the result with regex: [comment](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2208#issuecomment-582156037)

Ruby's regex is based on [Onigmo](https://github.com/k-takata/Onigmo) which itself is a fork of [Oniguruma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oniguruma). This might make a solid foundation/reference. Both are MIT licensed.

This is intended to be a pure-zig implementation. comptime literal compilation if possible.
