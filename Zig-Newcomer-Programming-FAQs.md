Hi this is a collaborative effort to note here quick answers to questions about programming in Zig that get asked frequently by newcomers.  
If you are about to answer a question for the third time in a row, write it here and then paste a link to cache it for the future :)  
_(maybe start by considering if it wouldn't be better to just edit an existing answer)_

## How do I parse a number from a string?
Use [`std.fmt.parseInt`](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/3bf72f2b3add70ad0671c668baf251f2db93abbf/lib/std/fmt.zig#L1357) or [`std.fmt.parseFloat`](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/3bf72f2b3add70ad0671c668baf251f2db93abbf/lib/std/fmt/parse_float.zig#L341).

## How do I do x with strings?
In zig, strings are just bytes, so the stdlib namespace you want to look at is `std.mem`, it has functions for concatenation, substring replacement, comparison, etc. the other namespace of interest to you will be `std.fmt` for formatting functions.
