# Agenda

### 1. Simplify translate-c implementation by introducing a new pseudo-ast data structures.
See [#6710](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/6710) for more context. This discussion point is championed by @andrewrk.

### 2. Middle-level IR.
It seems like this could be modeled as a sequence of lowering and optimization passes.  So something like
parse to ast -> comptime and semantic analysis -> runtime semantic IR -> backend agnostic optimizations -> backend -> backend-specific IR -> backend specific optimizations -> assembly.

The individual backends could do multiple passes of lowering followed by optimization, some of which are shared.  So you could make a "register machine"-specific IR and passes, and a "stack machine"-specific IR and passes, and each backend could choose to run the semantic IR through one of those shared lowering + optimization processes before doing really specific backend optimizations.

The problem with the value type you showed is neatly solved by this.  The problem is that you need to combine some low-level state about registers with high-level semantic state, because you're not able to go directly to assembly.  This solves that by introducing a new IR ("register machine IR") which gets produced from the semantic IR.  The code that produces this IR can be shared between any register machine backends, and then they can use the results in different ways to generate machine code.
Backends which aren't register machines, like wasm or the JVM, can do something different with the optimized semantic IR to produce their code.  And since the semantic IR doesn't have any machine specifics in it, there aren't any problems with incompatibility.

This discussion point is championed by @SpexGuy.

### 3. LLVM-backend for the self-hosted.
Will include a demo. This discussion point is championed by @FireFox317.

# Meeting notes

meeting minutes:
 * 6710 is accepted 
 * @Specs_guy 's middle level IR idea is good and we're gonna try to do it
 * @FireFox317 showed an impressive LLVM backend demo, looking forward to merging that. We discussed how it would integrate into the rest of the compiler design
 * @Vexu brought up 7146. I'm gonna review it, ponder it, and then we're going to do a 1:1 follow up discussion to figure stuff out, specifically regarding how to do incremental compilation


re: @Specs_guy idea,  it might be a nice idea to learn about https://mlir.llvm.org/ as inspiration. we're not going to depend on it because that would be yet another dependency on a c++ llvm project thing, but it's tackling the same problem, so it could have some important ideas for us to consider
